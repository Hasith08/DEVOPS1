<p>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar ( born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian cricketer and captain, widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.He took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years.
